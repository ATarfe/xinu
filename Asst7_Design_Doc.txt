This implementation of a shared memory mechanism uses a linked list which servers as a container
to store the key and shared segment id information.

- Whenever we need a new shared segment, we add a new node to this linked list.
- Whenever we need to access a shared segment, we just walk through this linked list until we
  find the node having the key.
- Whenever we need to delete a shared segment, we only remove the node in question and keep the
linked list in-tact.


We disable interrupts whenever we need to modify this linked list in order to maintain mutual exclusivity.


The shared segment id returned by shmget is the address of the node (which is the shared memory
container) in which the shared memory segment is located.

Other than that, we followed the instructions provided in "hw7.pdf".
