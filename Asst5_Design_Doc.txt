Since a future has a one-to-one relationship between the thread that set
the future and the thread that will get future, we simply chose to use a
binary semaphore (mutex) to force the getter thread to sleep until it is
woken up by the setter thread, when the future is set. In the mean time,
access from other threads to the future is protected by the state (which
would be set to FUTURE_WAITING).

For xsh_prodcons.c to accept the -f flag, we basically added a bunch of
if statements that scanned and parsed the arguments.

Other than that we followed the steps provided in the assignment.
